What keyword is used to make variables changeable? `mut`

How do you change a variable's type? Shadow it by using the `let` keyword again.

What are scalar datatypes? Scalar represents a single value; ints, floats, bools, and characters are the four primary scalar types in Rust

What are compound datatypes? Compound types can group multiple values into one type; Rust's primitive compound types are tuples and arrays.
